# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my study notes on "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto [@sutton2018]. These notes primarily focus on my solutions and insights while working through the exercises in the book.

I copy to the chapter and section structure of the book, presenting and solving the exercises within this framework. Additionally, sections with titles in lowercase are my own additions.
