# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my study notes on "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto [@sutton2018]. These notes primarily focus on my solutions and insights while working through the exercises in the book.

I largely copy to the chapter and section structure of the book. I recreate material from the book for the exercises as references and solve the exercises within this framework.

The depth of these notes can vary quite a bit. For some chapters I just copy the structure and present the exercises and their solutions. For others I go deeper and add my own insights
and also some additional sections. I mark those extra sections with a 🔍.

Note that these notes are still work in progress and even older chapters can change to a later time.

I hope the notes help you understand this great book better!
